Religious scholars have related that Allah has three thousand names. One thousand are only known by angels, 1,000 known only by prophets, 300 are in the Torah, 300 are in Zabur (Psalms of David) and 99 are in the Qur'an. One Name which has been hidden by Allah is called Ism Allah al-azam: The Greatest Name of Allah.
